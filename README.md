# 10PythonProjects

10 Python project from indently.io

Project 1:
I learned how to take user input and do operations with them, and also to check if they entered the wrong data type.

Project 2:
Here one of the main lessons was to be able to take any number of inputs based on other inputs. Plus better error checking to calculate the right values.

Project 3:
Learned more data types like tuples and counters, and how to take inputs from files.

Project 4:
First time I used tkinter to make a gui. I also learned how to save, load, and save to existing files the current state of the notepad.

Project 5:
Found out how to use the requests library and installed it with pip. Was a fun exercise to get information about a webpage.

Project 6:
Learned out to manipulate static json data. Also figured out how to convert the euro currency for the to rate that wasn't in the json file. I still have to try using an API to get real time exchanges but I will save that after I complete a few more projects.

Project 7:
I found about the secrets import and that it is more secure than random for encryption. Plus I gained more practice with manipulating strings and adding dynamic updating based on the current string.
