# 10PythonProjects

10 Python project from indently.io

Project 1:
I learned how to take user input and do operations with them, and also to check if they entered the wrong data type.

Project 2:
Here one of the main lessons was to be able to take any number of inputs based on other inputs. Plus better error checking to calculate the right values.

Project 3:
Learned more data types like tuples and counters, and how to take inputs from files.

Project 4:
First time I used tkinter to make a gui. I also learned how to save, load, and save to existing files the current state of the notepad.

Project 5:
Found out how to use the requests library and installed it with pip. Was a fun exercise to get information about a webpage.

Project 6:
Learned out to manipulate static json data. Also figured out how to convert the euro currency for the to rate that wasn't in the json file. I still have to try using an API to get real time exchanges but I will save that after I complete a few more projects.

Project 7:
I found about the secrets import and that it is more secure than random for encryption. Plus I gained more practice with manipulating strings and adding dynamic updating based on the current string.

Project 8:
Figured out how to make a text analyser and do more work with strings. I had a call back to project 3 with getting the most common words but now I only printed the top 5. Also I made the output more human readable and better looking.

Project 9:
First time trying to play with Morse Code. I had to research more about it and how to convert punctuation to morse code. Then I had to reverse the dictionary and convert morse code back to text.

Project 10:
Made a simple chatbot! Was fun to see how it works at a base level, for now I made a way to stop the chat. Plus I made it return a default message when the similarity was below 50%. I just have to add more messages but I can do that later this is just the start.
